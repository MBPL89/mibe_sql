## Regular expressions
In SQL, `REGEXP` (short for **regular expression**) is used to match a string against a pattern. It allows you to search for complex patterns in text data. It is often used to perform advanced searches, such as matching substrings, validating formats, or finding specific patterns in a column.

For example, the query below lists all brands containing 'Hotel' in their name. We don't know the exact names. Just that small piece.

``` {.sql .interactive .hr2}
SELECT brandName FROM brand
		WHERE brandName REGEXP 'hotel';
```

::: {.callout-note}
Pay attention how the syntax for REGEXP uses the WHERE clause (which is, again, great!ðŸ¤© because you already know how to use WHERE).

Common Regular Expression Syntax:

- `^` : Matches the start of a string.
- `$` : Matches the end of a string.
- `.` : Matches any single character.
- `*` : Matches 0 or more occurrences of the preceding element.
- `+` : Matches 1 or more occurrences of the preceding element.
- `[]` : Matches any character within the brackets.
- `[A-Z]` : Matches any upper case letter.
- `[a-z]` : Matches any lower case letter
- `[0-9]` : Matches any digit from 0 through to 9.
 
**Examples**
 
``` {.sql .interactive .hr2}
SELECT brandName FROM brand
		WHERE brandName REGEXP '^H';
```

``` {.sql .interactive .hr2}
SELECT brandName FROM brand
		WHERE brandName REGEXP '$or';
```

``` {.sql .interactive .hr2}
SELECT headquarters FROM lodgingchain
		WHERE headquarters REGEXP '[united]';
```

``` {.sql .interactive .hr2}
SELECT headquarters FROM lodgingchain
		WHERE headquarters REGEXP '[United]';
```

``` {.sql .interactive .hr2}
SELECT headquarters FROM lodgingchain
		WHERE headquarters REGEXP '+or';
```
