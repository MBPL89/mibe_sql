# CD Library Challenge

::::: {layout="[ 60, 40 ]"}
::: {#first-column}
Welcome to the CD Library Database Challenge! In this exercise, you'll put your SQL skills to work by querying a database that manages a collection of music CDs. As future business analysts and decision-makers, you'll need to extract meaningful insights from company databases. This challenge simulates a real-world scenario where you'll help a music store manager understand their inventory and track popular artists. Your task is to craft SQL queries that answer specific business questions and provide actionable intelligence.
