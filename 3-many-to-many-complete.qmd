# Database Modelling

One-to-many relationship will not always be enough to represent all the situations in real life.

## A sales form example

A sales form is a document or (digital) record that captures details of a sale, including the products sold, the quantities, the price, the date, and the customer information.

If you think about it, it would be hard to design a one-to-many relationship for a sales form:

-   You can sell (conceptually) the same item many times. (E.g. Yesterday you sold two IPhones. Today you also sold an IPhone.)

-   In one sale, you can sell various products. (E.g. A client bought an Iphone and an IPad.)

To represent this situation in database modeling, we would need a **many-to-many relationship** between sales and products. This is because a single sale can include multiple products, and the same product can be sold in multiple sales. To model this relationship, a junction table (often called sales_details or order_items) is used, linking the sales table (which stores each transaction) with the products table. This table typically includes fields such as sale_id, product_id, quantity, and price. The many-to-many nature of this relationship allows for flexibility in tracking sales history and inventory management.

## Implementing many-to-many

In a **many-to-many (m:m) relationship**, a **third entity** is required to properly map the connection between the two related entities. This third entity, known as an **associative entity**, acts as a bridge between them.

![](images/salesformmodel.png){.lightbox width="550"}

In database modeling, the **associative table** includes two **foreign keys**, one for each of the entities in the m:m relationship, ensuring that each instance of the relationship is properly recorded. Additionally, a foreign key can also be part of the **primary key** of the associative entity.

![](images/salesformtable.png){.lightbox width="550"}

For example, in a sales database, a `LINEITEM` table is used to associate `SALE` and `PRODUCT`. The `LINEITEM` table is identified by concatenating `lineno` and `saleno`, as indicated by the **+ on the crow’s foot notation**. This structure ensures data integrity and enforces the same relational rules as any other table in the database.

As you already know the concepts related to the implementable model, let's take a look at many-to-many model:

### Exercise

Let's go back to our hotel database. So far it was a fairly simple database. However, its' main purpose is not to track hotels. It stores data about hotel reviews, scraped from the Internet.

![](images/hotelreview.png){.lightbox width="750"}

**How would you model the following scenario?** - An author can write reviews about many hotels. - A hotel can have reviews written by many authors.

## Database Manipulation

So far, we’ve learned how to join tables using the `WHERE` clause—this is known as an implicit join. 

::: {.callout-note}
*Implicit JOIN (OR "Comma syntax" JOIN)*

`SELECT ... FROM ..., ... WHERE fk = pk;`

`SELECT * FROM table1, table2 WHERE table1.id = table2.id;`

:::

While implicit joins work, SQL also provides a more structured way to combine tables: explicit joins using keywords like `JOIN ... ON`.

The key difference is that implicit joins mix filtering (`WHERE`) with table relationships, making queries harder to read as they grow. Explicit joins, on the other hand, separate the logic of joining tables from filtering rows, improving readability and maintainability.

::: {.callout-note}
*Explicit JOIN*

`SELECT ... FROM ... JOIN ... ON fk = pk;`

`SELECT * FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id;`
:::

Different join syntaxes exist because SQL is designed to be flexible. In some cases, explicit joins provide better performance and clarity, especially when dealing with complex queries or different types of joins (we will see them later).

There many ways to JOIN tbles in SQL. All these methods are called Equijoin. 

Compare These queries:

``` {.sql .interactive .hr3}
SELECT * FROM brand, lodgingchain WHERE brand.chainId = lodgingchain.chainId;

```

``` {.sql .interactive .hr3}
SELECT * FROM brand JOIN lodgingchain ON brand.chainId = lodgingchain.chainId;

```

``` {.sql .interactive .hr3}
SELECT * FROM brand NATURAL JOIN lodgingchain;

```

``` {.sql .interactive .hr3}
SELECT * FROM brand JOIN lodgingchain USING(chainId);

```

### Three table join

List the authors that have reviewed hotels. Report the author name, the hotel ID and the name of the hotels. Order the output by author name.

Use all four methods

implicit JOIN (WHERE)
``` {.sql .interactive .hr3}
SELECT authorNickname, hotel.hotelId, hotelName
 FROM author, review, hotel
 WHERE review.authorId = author.authorId
 AND review.hotelId = hotel.hotelId
 ORDER BY authorNickname;

```

NATURAL JOIN
``` {.sql .interactive .hr3}
SELECT authorNickname, hotelId, hotelName 
 FROM author 
  NATURAL JOIN review 
  NATURAL JOIN hotel 
 ORDER BY authorNickname;

```

JOIN ... USING
``` {.sql .interactive .hr3}
SELECT authorNickname, hotelId, hotelName 
 FROM author 
  JOIN review USING(authorId) 
  JOIN hotel USING(hotelId) 
 ORDER BY authorNickname;
 
```

JOIN ... ON
``` {.sql .interactive .hr3}
SELECT authorNickname, hotel.hotelId, hotelName
 FROM author JOIN review JOIN hotel
  ON  hotel.hotelId = review.hotelId
  AND review.authorId = author.authorId
ORDER BY authorNickname;

```

#### Notes

**NATURAL JOIN**

* Join on “same” column (name and data type)
* Risky: the condition is implicit 

**USING()**

* Explicitly specifies columns in the equijoin
* Allows multiple (comma separated) columns 

**ON** 

* The ON clause enables multiple conditions
* Logical operator can be used to combine condition
* ON and USING are mutually exclusive
* ON enables inequality joins (Theta JOIN – more later) 

### JOIN Variations

So far, you've learner about `INNER JOIN`, which is the JOIN that returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables based on a specified condition. It eliminates unmatched rows from both tables, ensuring that only records with a relationship between them appear in the result set.

However, there are different JOINS too. An **OUTER JOIN** is a powerful SQL feature used when you want to retain *"dangling tuples"*—rows that don’t have a match in the other table. Unlike inner joins, which only return matching records, outer joins ensure that unmatched rows from one or both tables are included in the results. These missing values are padded with `NULLs` based on the type of outer join used.

* A `LEFT OUTER JOIN` returns all rows from the left table, along with matching rows from the right table. If there’s no match, NULLs are used for the right table’s columns.

::::: {layout="[ 30, 70 ]"}
::: {#first-column}
![](images/left_join.png){fig-align="center" width="350"}
:::

::: {#second-column}
![](images/table_left.png){.lightbox fig-align="center" width="350"}

`SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT OUTER JOIN t2 USING (id);`

:::
:::::

* A `RIGHT OUTER JOIN` does the opposite—it keeps all rows from the right table and includes matching rows from the left table, filling in NULLs when no match is found.

::::: {layout="[ 30, 70 ]"}
::: {#first-column}
![](images/right_join.png){fig-align="center" width="350"}

:::

::: {#second-column}
![](images/table_right.png){.lightbox fig-align="center" width="350"}

`SELECT * FROM t1 RIGHT OUTER JOIN t2 USING (id);`

:::
:::::

* A `FULL OUTER JOIN` includes all rows from both tables, ensuring that even non-matching rows from either table appear, with NULLs where data is missing.

::::: {layout="[ 30, 70 ]"}
::: {#first-column}
![](images/full_join.png){fig-align="center" width="350"}

:::

::: {#second-column}
![](images/table_full.png){fig-align="center" width="350"}

`SELECT * FROM t1 RIGHT OUTER JOIN t2 USING (id);`
:::
:::::

Outer joins are especially useful for analyzing incomplete data, maintaining records even when relationships are not fully established, and ensuring that no important information is lost in queries.

### Exercise

Provide a list of all chain names and their respective brands. Order the list by chain name.

**Tip:** Keep in mind that not all chains have sub-brands.

``` {.sql .interactive .hr3}
SELECT chainName, brandName
 FROM lodgingchain LEFT OUTER JOIN brand USING(chainId)
 ORDER BY chainName;

```
