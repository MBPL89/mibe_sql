# Coding and Database Managment

## SQL - Homework 5

::: callout-warning
You have to run these queries in Workbench (or Python program).
:::

The following queries use the **classicmodels** schema.

![Source: https://www.richardtwatson.com/](images/classic_models.png){.lightbox width="550"}

1.	Report the contact names for the customers having no sales representative. Try it with and without IS NULL.

2.	Select the product code and name of all the products that have not been sold. [Try with IS NULL]

3.	List the name, line and vendor of products in the 'Classic Cars' product line or from vendors that have ‘Gear’ in their name. [Try it with the UNION set operator]

4.	Count the total number of products in each product line. [Do not use an outer join]

5.	Report the total number of orders that shipped between 2003-06-06 and 2004-07-07. Meaningfully rename the output.

6.	Identify all the products that were sold at a discount greater than 5% but less than 10%.

7.	Report name, cost, MSRP and margin (MSRP- buyPrice) for the 5 most expensive products (highest MSRP). Limit your reporting to the products that sold at least 300 units (cumulative in all orders). [perform this query using LIMIT]

8.	Report the 10 most expensive products by MSRP [use LIMIT].

9.	Report the 10th most expensive product by MSRP [use LIMIT and OFFSET].

10.	Report all product information about the products with the second highest MSRP.

Challenge: Can you complete query 7 without using LIMIT?
