# Database Modelling

Now that you’ve learned how to model a basic, single-entity database, let’s explore **attributes**, which define the characteristics of an entity.

## Attributes

Attributes store important details about each record in a table, helping to describe and organize data effectively.

In a database, attributes can be classified based on whether they require a value. A **required** attribute must always have a value and cannot be left empty, while an **optional** attribute can be left empty (**NULL**).

::: callout-warning
We use **NULL** to indicate missing values. Missing values can occur for different reasons, such as an existing attribute without data (e.g., a middle name) or an inapplicable condition (e.g., an apartment number for a house address).

Don’t confuse NULL values with blank or zero.

Multiple meanings:

-   Unknown data
-   Inapplicable data
-   No value supplied
-   Value undefined

We will come back to NULL values later.
:::

Each attribute has a **domain**, which defines the set of possible values it can take.

::: callout-tip
A domain is the set of possible values that an attribute can have. Think of it like a rule that defines what kind of data is allowed in a column. For example, if you have an attribute "Age," its domain might be whole numbers between 0 and 120. If you have a "Country" attribute, its domain would be a list of valid country names. Domains help keep data consistent and prevent errors, like entering text in a column meant for numbers.
:::

To uniquely identify each record, **identifiers** are used—these are attributes that hold unique values for each instance. In relational databases, the primary key serves as this unique identifier.

Sometimes, a **composite identifier** is needed, which combines two or more attributes to uniquely identify a record (e.g., a combination of Course ID and Student ID to track enrollments).

Attributes can be classified into different types:

-   **Composite attribute**: Attribute that can be subdivided to yield additional attributes
-   **Simple attribute**: Attribute that cannot be subdivided
-   **Derived attribute**: Attribute whose value is calculated from other attributes
    -   Derived using an algorithm (i.e., Yield = Dividend \* Quantity)
    -   Sometimes called ‘calculated fields’
-   **Single-valued attribute**: Attribute that holds only a single value
-   **Multivalued attributes**: Attributes that hold many values

Understanding these attribute types is essential for designing efficient databases that accurately represent real-world scenarios.

## Multivalued attributes

Think of the data scientists database we modeled last week.

![](images/dsmodel1.png){fig-align="center" width="250"}

How would the model change, if our data scientist could get a second degree? Or multiple certificates?

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
![](images/dsmodel2.png){fig-align="center" width="350"}
:::

A multivalued attribute is an attribute that can have multiple values for a single entity. For example, an employee might have multiple phone numbers or an author might write multiple books. In database design, multivalued attributes should be handled properly to maintain data consistency. One approach is to create separate attributes for each component of the multivalued attribute (e.g., `Phone_1`, `Phone_2`). A better approach is to create a new entity that holds the multiple values, linking it to the original entity through a relationship (e.g., an `Employee_Phone` table linked to an `Employee` table). This ensures better organization, eliminates redundancy, and improves data integrity.

Now, try to apply that knowledge to our data scientists database.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
![](images/dsmodel3.png){fig-align="center" width="350"}
:::

## Entity Relaionship

There is one more new thing in the model above. Habe you noticed that the entities are "linked". These are entity relationships.

In database design, relationships define how different entities (tables) are associated with one another. These relationships follow **business rules**, which describe how entities interact based on real-world scenarios. For example:

-   a customer can place many orders
-   a team can have many players.

These relationships help ensure that data is properly structured and connected.

A key characteristic of relationships is that they are **bi-directional**, meaning they should always be read both ways. For example, while a customer can place many orders, each order is placed by only one customer. Understanding relationships in both directions is crucial for designing a clear and logical database structure.

Properly defining entity relationships improves data integrity, reduces redundancy, and enhances query efficiency. By embedding relationships directly into the database design, businesses can enforce rules and constraints that reflect real-world operations, making data retrieval and management more efficient.

Consider our brand table from last week. Let's say we want to track also info about lodging chains.

![](images/brand2.png){.lightbox fig-align="center" width="750"}

Since we have multiple hotels owned by the same chain, storing this information in one table would create redundancies.

It is better to create a new entity, and specify the relationship beween the two.

![](images/brandchain.png){fig-align="center" width="450"}

## One-to-many Relationship

This particular case of relationship is called **one-to-many** relationship.

A one-to-many relationship means that one record in a table is linked to many records in another table. Like in our case, one lodging chain can own many hotels, but each hotel belongs to only one chain. See the example of Hilton Hotels:

![](images/brandchain2.png){.lightbox fig-align="center" width="750"}

This type of relationship helps organize data efficiently, avoiding duplication and ensuring consistency.

Let's go back to our stock portfolio table for a second. Remember that it contains stock market data that is used by an investment firm dealing with international commodities and agricultural products.

![Stock market data](images/anomalies_table.png){.lightbox fig-align="center" width="700"}

We said that there might be several problems (called *anomalies*) with it:

-   **Insertion** anomalies occur when adding new data is difficult due to missing dependencies.
-   **Update** anomalies lead to inconsistencies when changes must be made in multiple places.
-   **Deletion** anomalies cause unintended data loss when removing a record also removes critical information.

Let's try to design a database to store our stock portfolio data!

### Exercise

Develop a data model for Marriott International to keep track of relevant information about its portfolio of hotels

Focus on the assets, not on customers, employees, or transactions

![](images/marriott.png){.lightbox fig-align="center" width="550"}

### Hierarchical relationships

**Hierarchical relationships** occur frequently in databases and follow a one-to-many structure, where one entity has multiple related entities beneath it. This structure is similar to a tree, where a parent node can have multiple child nodes, but each child has only one parent. For example, in a company database, one manager oversees many employees, but each employee has only one direct manager. Similarly, a firm can have many divisions, a division can have many departments, and a department can have many sections (see the example below).

These relationships help organize data logically and efficiently, making it easier to navigate and retrieve information.

![](images/hierarchical.png){.lightbox fig-align="center" width="550"}

## Mapping to a relational database

So far, we covered a lot of abstract terms like entity, instances, attributes etc. As you correctly notice, we could simply say table, row, and columns instead. However, there is a good reason for using these abstract terms.

Understanding **entities, instances, and attributes** rather than just **tables, rows, and columns** is important because it helps us focus on the **conceptual meaning of the data** rather than just its storage format.

-   **Entity vs. Table:** An **entity** represents a real-world object or concept (like a "Customer" or "Product"), while a **table** is just how we store data in a database. Thinking in terms of entities helps us design better database models before deciding how to implement them.\
-   **Instance vs. Row:** An **instance** is a specific example of an entity (e.g., a particular customer, "John Doe"). A **row** is how that instance is stored in a table. Thinking in terms of instances makes it easier to understand relationships between data.\
-   **Attribute vs. Column:** An **attribute** describes a characteristic of an entity (e.g., a customer's "Name" or "Email"). A **column** is just where this data is stored. By focusing on attributes first, we ensure that all necessary information is captured properly.

By using these **abstract concepts**, we can design flexible and well-structured databases **before** deciding how to implement them in a specific DBMS.

#### Mapping Entities to Tables

When designing a relational database, entities and their relationships are translated into tables and columns. The process follows these key steps:

-   **Each entity becomes a table**\
-   **The entity name becomes the table name**\
-   **Each attribute becomes a column**

#### Handling One-to-Many Relationships

In a one-to-many relationship, we structure the tables as follows:

-   **Add a column to the table on the "many" side of the relationship**\
-   **Store the identifier of the "one" side in this added column**

This ensures proper linkage between related data while maintaining database integrity.

#### Parsimonious notation

::: callout-warning
The conceptual database model uses a parsimonious notation, meaning that extra attributes do not need to be explicitly modeled, as they can be inferred from the relationship.

#### Integrity constraint

Ensuring data integrity is crucial in relational databases. **Entity integrity** maintains the uniqueness and validity of primary keys, while **referential integrity** ensures that foreign keys correctly reference existing primary keys. These rules help prevent inconsistencies and maintain reliable relationships between tables.

##### Entity Integrity

-   A **primary key** must be **unique**.\
-   Primary keys **can never have NULL values**.

##### Referential Integrity

-   For every **non-null value** of a **foreign key**, there must be a **matching primary key** with that value.\
-   **Example:** For every value of `chainID` in the `brand` table, there must be a corresponding value of `chainID` in the `lodgingChain` table.\
-   A **primary key must exist** before a foreign key can be defined.

##Implementable database model

Remember these beatiful drawings?

![ER diagram](images/ERD.png){width="350"}
:::

So far, we mainly focused on a **conceptual** database model. But there is also **implementational** (or logical) database model.

The **conceptual database model** focuses on the high-level structure of the data, emphasizing entities, relationships, and constraints without considering how the data will be physically stored. It serves as a *blueprint* for understanding data requirements and is independent of any specific database management system (DBMS). On the other hand, the **implementational database model** translates the conceptual design into a format that a DBMS can use, incorporating tables, columns, keys, and constraints based on a specific database system. While the conceptual model is abstract and business-oriented, the implementational model is detailed and technical, bridging the gap between design and actual database implementation.

We will learn how to design such implementational models in few weeks. First, let's learn how to read them.

### Identifying and non-identifying relationships

In database modeling, **identifying** and **non-identifying** relationships refer to how entities are related to one another. An identifying relationship occurs when the child entity’s existence depends on the parent entity, and the child entity's primary key includes the parent's primary key. This often happens in cases where the child cannot exist without the parent (e.g., an order item cannot exist without an order). In contrast, a non-identifying relationship occurs when the child entity can exist independently of the parent entity, and the child’s primary key does not include the parent’s primary key. Here, the relationship is more loosely coupled (e.g., a customer can exist without an address).

In the implementational model, the relationships will look slightly differnt.

:::

::: callout-note
In the conceptual model, we will have to add a small plus (+) over a relationship, to mark the identifying relationship.

# Database Manipulation

This week we will start querying models that are slightly more advanced. You know now, that we can have models with more than one table and a relationship between them. Our hotel database evolved accordingly and we now store the data about lodging chaing in a separate table called *lodgingChain*.

![](images/modelsession2.png){fig-align="center" width="450"}

## Aggregate functions

In SQL aggregate functions help you combine lots of data into one result. These are like math operations that work on whole columns of information instead of just single values.

Here are the main aggregate functions:

-   **COUNT()**: Tells you how many items are in your data (like counting how many customers you have)
-   **SUM()**: Adds up numbers (like finding your total sales for the month)
-   **AVG()**: Calculates the average (like finding the typical price of products)
-   **MIN()**: Finds the smallest value (like identifying your cheapest item)
-   **MAX()**: Finds the largest value (like identifying your most expensive item)

These functions are super helpful when you want to get quick summaries from your database without looking at every single row of information. You simply add the to your query follwoing this pattern:

``` {.sql .interactive .hr2-not-editable}
SELECT FUNCTION(columnName) FROM tableName;
```

Let's test them in our *brand* table!

*Find the average hotel room square footage for all brands.*

``` {.sql .interactive .hr2}
SELECT AVG(brandMinSqFt) AS avgArea FROM brand;
```

*What is the area of the largest hotel room specification in the DB? Rename as “Biggest Room”*

``` {.sql .interactive .hr2}
SELECT MAX(brandMinSqFt) AS 'Biggest Room' FROM brand;
```

*How many total brands do we have data for?*

``` {.sql .interactive .hr2}
SELECT COUNT(*)FROM brand;
```

::: callout-tip
The query below is an equivalent to the previous one. Can you explain why?
:::

``` {.sql .interactive .hr2}
SELECT COUNT(brandName)FROM brand;
```

*What is the total number of hotel rooms? - All rooms of all chains.*

::: callout-tip
The solve this task, you will have to query different table...
:::

``` {.sql .interactive .hr2}
SELECT SUM(numRooms) FROM lodgingchain;
```

## JOINing tables

Joining tables in SQL allows you to *combine related data from different tables* into a single result set. The simplest way to join tables is using the **WHERE** clause with the equals operator (which is great!🤩 because you already know how to use WHERE).

Here's how it works:

-   **Basic JOIN using WHERE**: You list both tables in the FROM clause and use WHERE to match related columns
-   **Example syntax**: `SELECT * FROM brand, lodgingchain WHERE brand.chainID = lodgingchain.chainID;`
-   **How it works**: This tells SQL to match each row from the first table with rows from the second table where the specified columns have the same value
-   **Result**: Only rows where the join condition is true appear in your results

This approach creates what's known as an "inner join" - it only shows data where there are matches between both tables. We will explore more powerful ways to join tables in our next session.

*Try it yourself!*

``` {.sql .interactive .hr2}
SELECT * FROM brand, lodgingchain 
  WHERE brand.chainID = lodgingchain.chainID;
```

### Exercise

*Report the headquarter location of each brand’s parent chain.Order by brand name.*

``` {.sql .interactive .hr2}
SELECT brandName, headquarters
    FROM brand,lodgingchain
    WHERE brand.chainID = lodgingchain.chainID
    ORDER BY brandName;
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## Watch out for cross-products
A cross-product in SQL occurs when you join two tables without specifying a join condition. This creates a result set containing every possible combination of rows from both tables. For example, if you run `SELECT * FROM brand, lodgingchain;` without a WHERE clause, each row from the brand table will be paired with every row from the lodgingchain table. If your brand table has 100 rows and your lodgingchain table has 500 rows, you'll end up with 50,000 rows in your result set. 

Cross-products are rarely useful in practical applications and can cause serious performance problems with large tables, which is why properly specifying join conditions with WHERE clauses is essential for efficient queries.

``` {.sql .interactive .hr2}
SELECT * FROM brand, lodgingchain;
```

::: {.callout-warning}
## The risk of homonyms
Homonyms in database design—particularly columns with identical names across different tables—create risks. When fields like "id" or "status" appear in multiple tables but represent different concepts, developers may mistakenly join these columns or apply incorrect business logic. This confusion leads to flawed queries, unpredictable results, and potential data corruption. 

To prevent these issues, best practices include using descriptive, context-specific column names (e.g., "customer_id" instead of just "id"), implementing consistent naming conventions, and maintaining clear documentation of each column's specific meaning and purpose.

However, sometimes you may find a database with homonyms. Let's take a look at our nation-stock database. Try to run the query below. What is the result? How would you change the query to get the correct result? 

![](images/implnatstock.png){.lightbox fig-align="center" width="250"} 

``` {.sql .interactive .ns}
SELECT * FROM stock, nation
	WHERE stock.natcode = nation.natcode;
	
```

:::

## Grouping the results

The **GROUP BY** clause in SQL allows you to organize similar data into groups and perform aggregate functions on each group separately rather than on the entire table.

Here's how it works:

-   **Basic purpose**: Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns
-   **Typical usage**: Used with aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.) to perform calculations on each group
-   **Example syntax**: `SELECT chainHQ, COUNT(*) FROM lodgingChaing GROUP BY chainHQ;`
-   **Result**: One row for each unique value in the grouped column(s)
-   **Multiple columns**: You can group by multiple columns like `GROUP BY department, job_title`
-   **Common requirement**: Generally, columns in the SELECT list must either be part of the GROUP BY clause or used within an aggregate function

``` {.sql .interactive .hr2}
SELECT headquarters, COUNT(*) FROM lodgingchain 
  GROUP BY headquarters;
```

**GROUP BY** is essential for summarizing data and generating reports that show totals, averages, or counts for different categories within your data.

#### Exercise

*Report number of brands in each chain by chain name (not chainID).*

``` {.sql .interactive .hr2}
SELECT chainName, COUNT(brandName) AS NumBrands
    FROM brand, lodgingchain 
    WHERE brand.chainID = lodgingchain.chainID
    GROUP BY chainName;
```

### HAVING

In SQL, the `HAVING` clause is used to filter the results of a `GROUP BY` query. It is like `WHERE` clause for grouped results. However, `HAVING` allows you to filter groups based on aggregate functions (like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, etc.), which cannot be done using the `WHERE` clause.

::: callout-note
The `WHERE` clause filters rows before they are grouped, while `HAVING` filters groups after the aggregation is done.
:::

Consider the previous example. We can easily filter the results and keep only, for example, countries with at least 3 headquarters.

``` {.sql .interactive .hr2}
SELECT headquarters, COUNT(*) FROM lodgingchain 
  GROUP BY headquarters
  HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3;
```

#### Exercise

*Report the average room area and number of brands for all chains that own more than one brand*

``` {.sql .interactive .hr2}
SELECT chainName, AVG(brandMinSqFt) AS avgArea, COUNT(*) AS totalBrands
    FROM brand, lodgingchain 
    WHERE lodgingchain.chainID = brand.chainID  
    GROUP BY chainName 
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2;
```

## Subqueries

A **subquery** is a query that is nested inside another query. It is used to retrieve data that will be used in the main query for filtering, selecting, or computing results. Subqueries can be placed in the `SELECT`, `FROM`, or `WHERE` clauses of a SQL query.

There are two main types of subqueries: 1. **Scalar subqueries**: Return a single value. 2. **Table subqueries**: Return multiple rows and columns.

For now, we will only focus on scalar subqueries.

**When to Use Subqueries**:

-   When you need to compare a value in a column with a result from another query.
-   When you want to perform an operation on a subset of data before using it in the main query.
-   When a join is not possible or too complex to use.

### Example of a Subquery in the `WHERE` Clause:

*Report the name of all brands headquartered in the same country as the Grand Hyatt.*

``` {.sql .interactive .hr2}
SELECT brandName FROM lodgingChain, brand 
  WHERE lodgingChain.chainID = brand.chainID 
  AND headquarters IN (SELECT headquarters 
                FROM lodgingChain, brand
                WHERE lodgingChain.chainID = brand.chainID 
                AND brandName='Grand Hyatt');
```

A subquery in the `WHERE` clause can be used to filter results based on data from another table. You can run the subquery as a separate query and see its results.

``` {.sql .interactive .hr2}
SELECT headquarters FROM lodgingChain, brand
  WHERE lodgingChain.chainID = brand.chainID 
  AND brandName='Grand Hyatt'
```

### Exercise

*Report all data about the oldest chain with worldwide presence (i.e., founded earliest)*

``` {.sql .interactive .hr2}
SELECT * FROM lodgingchain 
  WHERE yearfounded = (
    SELECT MIN(yearfounded) FROM lodgingchain);
```

## Extra practice cell

``` {.sql .interactive .hr2}
```
