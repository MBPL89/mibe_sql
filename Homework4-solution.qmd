 WHERE boss.reportsTo IS NULL; 
```

2.  Who reports to directly to William Patterson?

SELECT emp.lastName, emp.firstName 
 FROM employees as emp JOIN employees boss
  ON emp.reportsTo = boss.employeeNumber
 WHERE boss.lastName = 'Patterson'

3.  List the employees who report to those employees who report to Diane Murphy.

``` sql
SELECT emp.lastName, emp.firstName , emp.employeeNumber, emp.reportsTo
 FROM employees as emp JOIN employees as boss JOIN employees as bigboss
  ON emp.reportsTo = boss.employeeNumber
  AND boss.reportsTo = bigboss.employeeNumber
 WHERE bigboss.lastName = 'Murphy'
 AND bigboss.firstName = 'Diane';
    
```

4.  How many employees report to the Sales Manager that is employee named 'Bow Anthony'? Rename the column as "Mr. Bow's Direct Reports"

``` sql
SELECT  count(emp.reportsTo) AS 'Mr. Bows Direct Reports'
 FROM employees as emp JOIN employees boss
  ON emp.reportsTo = boss.employeeNumber
 WHERE boss.employeeNumber IN (SELECT employeeNumber 
                                FROM employees 
                                WHERE firstName= 'Anthony' AND lastName= 'Bow');
    
```

5.  Find the pair of customer that have the same credit limit. Omit the customers having no credit limit (That is creditlimit = 0): Report the customer name and credit limit for each pair and be sure to avoid unnecessary duplication.

``` sql
SELECT a.customerName, b.customerName, a.creditLimit, b.creditLimit
 FROM customers AS a JOIN customers AS b
  ON a.customerName> b.customerName
 WHERE a.creditLimit = b.creditLimit
 AND b.creditLimit !=0; 
```
