## Exercise 1: Hotel Brand Performance Analysis

### Objective:
Write a Python program that connects to the database, retrieves hotel ratings and brand information, and analyzes the average rating for each brand.

### Instructions:

* Connect to the database using Python (mysql.connector or SQLAlchemy).
* Retrieve the average hotelStarRating for each brand.
* Display the results in a sorted table (highest-rated brands first).

### Hints:

* The hotel table contains the hotelStarRating and brandId.
* The brand table contains brand details.
* Use GROUP BY and AVG() in SQL.

### Expected Outcome:
A dictionary of brands with their average star rating, sorted by star rating.

```
'Park Hyatt': 5.0,
 'Mandarin Oriental': 5.0,
 'Luxury Collection': 5.0,
 'Four Seasons': 4.96154,
 'Ritz-Carlton': 4.95833,
 'Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts': 4.83333,
 'Taj': 4.66667,
 'Conrad': 4.66667,
 'Sofitel': 4.4,
 ...

## Exercise 2: Sentiment Analysis on Hotel Reviews

### Objective:
Write a Python program that connects to a MySQL database, retrieves hotel reviews and their ratings, and classifies each review as Positive, Neutral, or Negative based on its rating.

### Classification Rules:

* Negative Review: Rating < 3
* Neutral Review: Rating = 3
* Positive Review: Rating > 3

### Tasks:

1. Connect to the MySQL database
* Use MySQL Connector (mysql.connector) to connect to the database.
* Retrieve reviews and ratings
* Query the database to get the hotel name, review text, and rating.

2. Classify reviews based on rating
* Use the classification rules to assign a sentiment category (Positive, Neutral, Negative).
* Count how many reviews fall into each category for each hotel.

3. Find and display:
* The top 5 hotels with the most positive reviews.
* The top 5 hotels with the most negative reviews.

### Expected output 

```
Top 5 Hotels with Most Positive Reviews:
The New Yorker Hotel: 584 positive reviews
Distrikt Hotel: 580 positive reviews
Staybridge Suites Times Square - New York City: 558 positive reviews
Hilton Garden Inn Times Square: 556 positive reviews
Le Parker Meridien: 552 positive reviews

Top 5 Hotels with Most Negative Reviews:
Hotel Pennsylvania New York: 362 negative reviews
Hudson New York: 202 negative reviews
Milford Plaza Hotel: 184 negative reviews
Hotel Carter: 147 negative reviews
