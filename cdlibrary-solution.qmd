# CD Library Challenge

::::: {layout="[ 60, 40 ]"}
::: {#first-column}
Welcome to the CD Library Database Challenge! In this exercise, you'll put your SQL skills to work by querying a database that manages a collection of music CDs. As future business analysts and decision-makers, you'll need to extract meaningful insights from company databases. This challenge simulates a real-world scenario where you'll help a music store manager understand their inventory and track popular artists. Your task is to craft SQL queries that answer specific business questions and provide actionable intelligence.

      WHERE grpname = 'Asleep at the Wheel';
    ```

2.  List all CDs that have any tracks featuring Asleep at the Wheel.

    ``` {.sql .interactive .cd}

   FROM grp JOIN group_recording
         ON grp.grpid = group_recording.grpid
         JOIN recording ON  recording.rcdid = group_recording.rcdid
        JOIN track ON recording.rcdid = track.rcdid
        JOIN cd ON  cd.cdid = track.cdid 
	    WHERE grpname = 'Asleep at the Wheel';
    ```

3.  Who are the members of Manhattan Transfer?

    ```

6.  Report all compositions and their composers where more than one person was involved in composing the music.

      WHERE person.psnid = person_composition.psnid
      AND composition.compid = person_composition.compid
      AND composition.compid IN
         (SELECT compid FROM person_composition
            GROUP BY compid HAVING COUNT(*) > 1);
    ```

7.  List all CDs featuring more than one group.

    ``` {.sql .interactive .cd}
    SELECT cdtitle
