## SQL - Homework 5

::: callout-warning
You have to run these queries in Workbench (or Python program).
:::

The following queries use the **classicmodels** schema.

![Source: https://www.richardtwatson.com/](images/classic_models.png){.lightbox width="550"}

1.  Report the contact names for the customers having no sales representative. Try it with and without IS NULL.

``` {.sql}
SELECT contactFirstName, contactLastName 
 FROM customers
 WHERE salesRepEmployeeNumber IS NULL;
```

``` {.sql}
SELECT contactFirstName, contactLastName 
 FROM customers
 WHERE (SELECT COUNT(salesRepEmployeeNumber) FROM customers AS c2
					WHERE customers.customerNumber = c2.customerNumber) = 0;
```

2.  Select the product code and name of all the products that have not been sold. \[Try with IS NULL\]

``` {.sql .interactive .cm}
SELECT productCode, productName
 FROM products LEFT JOIN orderdetails USING(productCode)
 WHERE orderNumber IS NULL;
```

3.  List the name, line and vendor of products in the 'Classic Cars' product line or from vendors that have ‘Gear’ in their name. \[Try it with the UNION set operator\]

``` {.sql}
SELECT productName, productLine, productVendor
 FROM products
 WHERE productLine = 'Classic Cars'
UNION
SELECT productName, productLine, productVendor
 FROM products
 WHERE productVendor REGEXP 'Gear';
```

4.  Count the total number of products in each product line. \[Do not use an outer join\]

``` {.sql}
SELECT productLine, COUNT(*) AS Tot
 FROM products JOIN productlines USING(productLine)
 GROUP BY productLine
UNION
SELECT productLine, 0
 FROM products
 WHERE productLine NOT IN (SELECT productLine FROM productlines)
 ORDER BY Tot;
```

5.  Report the total number of orders that shipped between 2003-06-06 and 2004-07-07. Meaningfully rename the output.

``` {.sql}
SELECT count( distinct orderNumber) as 'Total orders shipped within this period'
 FROM orderdetails JOIN orders USING (orderNumber)
 WHERE orders.shippedDate BETWEEN '2003-06-06' AND '2004-06-06';
```

An alternative solution
``` {.sql}
SELECT count(orderNumber) as 'Total orders shipped within this period'
 FROM orders 
 WHERE shippedDate BETWEEN '2003-06-06' AND '2004-06-06';
```

6.  Identify all the products that were sold at a discount greater than 5% but less than 10%.

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/mysql/func_mysql_format.asp" target="_blank">FORMAT()</a> in the solution below is optional, but it helps to make the output more readable.

``` {.sql}
SELECT productName ,FORMAT(((MSRP-priceEach)/MSRP)*100, 3) AS 'DISCOUNT_percent'
	FROM products join orderdetails USING (productCode)
    WHERE FORMAT(((MSRP-priceEach)/MSRP)*100, 3) > 5
	  and FORMAT(((MSRP-priceEach)/MSRP)*100, 3) < 10;
```

7.  Report name, cost, MSRP and margin (MSRP- buyPrice) for the 5 most expensive products (highest MSRP). Limit your reporting to the products that sold at least 300 units (cumulative in all orders). \[perform this query using LIMIT\]

``` {.sql}
SELECT productCode, productName, buyPrice, MSRP, (MSRP - buyPrice) as 'Margin', sum(quantityOrdered) as 'Total'
	FROM products JOIN orderdetails USING (productCode)
	GROUP BY productCode
	HAVING (sum(quantityOrdered)) > 300
	ORDER BY MSRP DESC 
	LIMIT 5;
```

8.  Report the 10 most expensive products by MSRP \[use LIMIT\].

``` {.sql}
SELECT productName, MSRP FROM products 
	ORDER BY MSRP DESC LIMIT 10;
```

9.  Report the 10th most expensive product by MSRP \[use LIMIT and OFFSET\].

``` {.sql}
SELECT productName, MSRP FROM products 
	ORDER BY MSRP DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 9;
```

10. Report all product information about the products with the second highest MSRP.

``` {.sql .interactive .cm}
SELECT * FROM products 
	ORDER BY MSRP DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;
```

Challenge: Can you complete query 7 without using LIMIT?

``` {.sql .interactive .cm}
SELECT productCode, productName, buyPrice, MSRP, (MSRP - buyPrice) as 'Margin', sum(quantityOrdered) as 'Total'
	FROM products JOIN orderdetails USING (productCode)
    WHERE 5 > (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products as P1
				WHERE products.MSRP < P1.MSRP)
	GROUP BY productCode
	HAVING (sum(quantityOrdered)) > 300
    ORDER BY MSRP DESC;
```
